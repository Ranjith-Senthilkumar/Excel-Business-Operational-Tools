# Excel Tools for Business Analytics

This repository contains two Excel-based tools created for analyzing project priorities and customer discount approvals. These tools are designed to assist in making data-driven decisions in business operations.

## Tools

### 1. Project Priority Matrix
The **Project Priority Matrix** is a tool that helps businesses visualize and prioritize their projects based on three main criteria:
- **Feasibility**: How easy or difficult the project is to implement.
- **Impact**: The potential positive effect the project will have on the organization.
- **Size**: The scale or magnitude of the project.

Projects are mapped into four categories:
- **Major Projects**: High feasibility and impact.
- **Quick Wins**: High impact but smaller in size.
- **May Be Later**: Low feasibility and impact.
- **Nice to Have**: Projects that could be implemented if resources are available.

The matrix helps in better decision-making by categorizing projects based on their value to the company.

### 2. Customer Discount Approval
The **Customer Discount Approval** tool is designed to assist in evaluating different discount scenarios for customers. It includes:
- **Best Case**, **Realistic**, and **Worst Case** scenarios for sales.
- Key parameters such as Discount %, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and Average Net Invoice Price (NIP) are included to calculate the projected sales, costs, and gross margin.
- The tool visually displays the gross margin against the target to easily assess whether the discount meets business goals.

## Features
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Both tools use input data to generate insights that help businesses make better decisions.
- **Visual Representation**: Excel charts are used to visually represent the data, making it easy to understand and compare.
- **Customizable**: The tools are fully customizable for different business contexts, allowing users to modify input parameters as needed.
